# Make Targeter for Eclipse/CDT

Make Targeter aims to help creating and building C/C++ make targets for projects where lots of build options are available in makefile. Settings for each project are saved in an simple xml file inside the project, so everything is human-readable and version-controllable.

Just open MakeTargeter view

![Find MakeTargeter view in Views->Make](plugin/docs/views.png?raw=true "Open view from Views->Make")

![MakeTargeter main view](plugin/docs/maketergeter_1.2.1.png?raw=true "MakeTargeter view")

Choose make target, set options via GUI, and then with a single click:
* Build your project with specified settings;
* Create a regular CDT Make target from these settings;
* Set to project build settings.

MakeTargeter will also show a build command configured in the project settings and in maketargeter window itself
